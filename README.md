# Meal Mate

MealMate is an innovative solution for college canteens that aims to improve the efficiency of their payment systems. The project is built using Django, a popular web development framework in Python.
The application has two main modules - student and canteen staff. The student module allows students to sign up, sign in, update their profile information, and update their password. Additionally, students can add their facial data by capturing their face image and add funds to their e-wallet. Students can view their transaction history and order history, add items to their cart, view their cart, and place an order by proceeding to checkout. To complete the payment process, the student will need to enter their password, and the amount will be withdrawn from their e-wallet. The student can view their receipt and download it. Additionally, students can provide feedback about the food items they ordered.
The canteen staff module allows staff members to add new menu items, edit and delete existing items, and place new orders for students. To place an order, the staff will scan the student's face to identify them, after which the menu window will show the items available for purchase. Staff members can add items to the cart for the student, and the payment will be made from the student's e-wallet. Staff members can view their online and offline orders, view reviews from students, and access statistics about sales.
The application uses the latest technology, including facial recognition and virtual wallets, to make payments more convenient, secure, and hygienic for students and staff. The use of virtual wallets eliminates the need for cash or physical cards, reducing the time spent in queues and the overall workload for canteen staff. MealMate is a user-friendly solution that can be easily integrated into existing canteen infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and accessible option for colleges of all sizes.
Overall, MealMate is a great project that solves a significant problem for college canteens. The use of technology makes the payment process more convenient, secure, and efficient for both students and staff members.
